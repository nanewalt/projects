misc projects:
Jumble of side projects I've completed in my free time

Overview:

Type_Racer.py -> Bot to compete on typeracer.com with automated game entry, text detection, and human-like keystroke patterns.
  Can set custom words per minute (will only go up to ~280 to prevent disqualification and the website has a captcha test for
  any wpm >= 100) or turn on FULLSPEED to optimize speed (~430) but will be immediately disqualified for cheating.
  
Snake -> Very simple snake game made in pygame. Will use as template for NEAT testing along with other projects.
